However, Trello's platform features proved to be invaluable in helping us save time and begin with a well-organized plan. Throughout the development process, working as a team lead was both enjoyable and fulfilling. I aimed to inspire our team of developers by fostering a culture of respect and collaboration. The experience was not only fun but also highlighted the importance of effective leadership in maintaining a positive and productive development atmosphere.`,

Then one day while surfing around Facebook, I found Nest Academy randomly. I had no idea about its academy until participating in a coding test lesson by myself. Ever since the participation day, I knew it would help me in my future career.`,
